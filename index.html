                        <p>The emergence of the Internet and the freedom of information on the Web create new ways to access, store and present data.  An interactive multimedia timeline can overcome those limitations of traditional printed media on teaching and learning History.</p>
                        <p>Conceived as an interactive, multimedia digital instrument, this <a href="http://timereach.montage.site/" target="_blank">demonstration of the TimeReach tool</a> describes multilayered historical data, dynamically linked to afford both far-reaching and in-depth presentations of the built environment over time.</p>
                        <p>We are developing this to be a highly accessible method to arouse interest in learning history. Through its multi-media format, employing a multi-panel viewing approach, the user’s comprehension will be greatly enhanced.</p>

                        <p>TimeReach is a suite of developing technologies for viewing many types of data in a familiar timeline format. Through an interactive web-based application, users input data and media about a particular event, and the system <b>dynamically generates</b> an interactive display. The display also allows users to filter the available data with text and categorical inputs, altering the timeline in real time. Future tools will also allow visual linking, mapping of associated locations, crowdsourcing of data, and much more.</p>
                        <p>The tool displays data of the history of environmental design, including Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Urban Planning, Engineering, and many other fields. The TimeReach team is curating the data to provide an authoritative academic presentation of the topic of Environmental Design of the 20th Century and its major influences.</p>
                        <p>Many more tools are under development to provide more interactivity for users. Individuals and organizations will be able to create their own custom presentations with secure log-in for editing data to be displayed. With a team of Internet experts and innovators, we are creating a comprehensive system of data management that will evolve for years to come.</p>

                        <p>Metaphorically, TimeReach functions as a time machine for the conscious mind to experience a profoundly different way of learning. It can be used by a professor to deliver a lecture on a specifically arranged topic in classroom settings. Our prototype has attracted enthusiastic support from prominent design professionals and schools. TimeReach can be used by professionals in the industry to collaborate and communicate topics and projects of any interest.</p>
                        <p>The future of TimeReach is limited only by the data users wish to explore. We invite you to contact us and share your perspectives on History and exploring time-relational information. We envision this as a useful tool for everyone interested in viewing and understanding the relationships of time-related data.</p>
